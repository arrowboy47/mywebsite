description: "How I designed, built, and themed this portfolio using React, Tailwind, and Catppuccin."

This site started as a simple idea — a personal hub that combines **professional projects** and **personal interests**.

### What I used
- React for the frontend
- TailwindCSS for styling
- GitHub Pages for hosting

I also used **Vite** for blazing-fast dev builds.

You can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/arrowboy47).
