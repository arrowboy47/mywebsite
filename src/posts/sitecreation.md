I got the idea to create this site to showcase projects that I am working on and anything else interesting. Thought it was a cool way to combine **professional projects** and **personal interests**.

### What I used
- React for the frontend
- TailwindCSS for styling
- GitHub Pages for hosting

I also used **Vite** for dev builds.
